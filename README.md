### ***Description***

#### Our project is a fitness, health and wellness of mind hub where anyone can come and learn from a plethora of teachers about how we can take care of our bodies. Teachers register and post what they deem basic knowledge about careful upkeep of our bodies. For basic users looking to make changes in their everyday lifestyle they have access to all this knowledge and apply what is helpful to them. Aswell as comment about their experience or any questions they may have.

#### Try Mindify!
